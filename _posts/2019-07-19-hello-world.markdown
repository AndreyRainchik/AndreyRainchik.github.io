Hello, everyone! This is my first post on my new blog, where I will be posting about infosec-related topics, such as writeups for different capture-the-flag challenges I complete or, if I get lucky enough to do so, any vulnerabilities I find or exploits I develop.

## Behind the Scenes

This blog runs on Github pages and is built off of the [Flexible-Jekyll][template] template created by Artem Sheludko, big thanks to him.

## About Me

I'm currently working as a security consultant at [NetSPI][netspi], where my main focuses are on web application and cloud services penetration testing. Before that, I worked for the University of Minnesota doing technical support, networking, security analysis, and incident response, all for the College of Science and Engineering. I also held internships for US Bank where I was on the IAM and SIEM teams.
